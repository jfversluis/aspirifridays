# BingoBoard.Admin - AspiriFridays Bingo Admin Dashboard

## Overview

The BingoBoard.Admin project is a Blazor Server application that provides an administrative interface for managing the AspiriFridays Bingo Board. It allows administrators to monitor connected clients, manage bingo squares, and interact with clients in real-time using SignalR.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Features (As per specification)

1. **Admin Dashboard**
   - User-friendly dashboard to manage bingo squares
   - Display list of connected clients with their status
   - Real-time updates when squares are checked/unchecked
   - Admin can send updates to all clients

2. **Customizable Bingo Sets**
   - 33+ predefined bingo squares with categorization
   - Random selection of 25 squares for each client (24 + 1 free space)
   - Each square has: `label`, `id`, `type` (categorization)
   - Free space automatically placed in center and marked as checked

3. **Client Connection Management**
   - Track all connected clients with connection details
   - Store current bingo set for each client in cache
   - Real-time connection/disconnection notifications
   - Admin can verify current bingo set for each client

### ✅ Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Blazor Server with Bootstrap 5 and Font Awesome icons
- **Real-time Communication**: SignalR Hub for bidirectional communication
- **Caching**: Distributed memory cache (in-memory for development, Redis-ready for production)
- **Architecture**: Clean separation with services and models

## SignalR Hub Methods

### Client → Admin Messages
- `RequestBingoSet(userName?)` - Client requests a new bingo set
- `UpdateSquare(squareId, isChecked)` - Client updates their own square
- `GetCurrentBingoSet()` - Client requests their current bingo set

### Admin → Client Messages  
- `AdminUpdateSquare(clientId, squareId, isChecked)` - Admin updates square for specific client
- `GetConnectedClients()` - Admin requests list of connected clients

### Broadcast Messages (Hub → All)
- `UserConnected` - New client connected
- `UserDisconnected` - Client disconnected  
- `BingoAchieved` - Client achieved bingo
- `SquareUpdated` - Square status changed
- `BingoSetReceived` - New bingo set generated

## Key Services

### BingoService
- Manages the 33+ available bingo squares
- Generates random 5x5 bingo sets for clients
- Handles square status updates
- Checks for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Stores/retrieves bingo sets from cache

### ClientConnectionService  
- Tracks connected clients and their metadata
- Associates bingo sets with client connections
- Manages client activity timestamps
- Stores client information in distributed cache

## Configuration

### Development
- Uses in-memory distributed cache
- Default SignalR hub at `/bingohub`
- Bootstrap 5 and Font Awesome 6.4.0 via CDN

### Production Ready
- Redis connection string configurable via `appsettings.json`
- Environment-specific caching (memory for dev, Redis for prod)
- Logging and error handling implemented

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**: .NET 9.0 SDK
2. **Build**: `dotnet build`
3. **Run**: `dotnet run`
4. **Access**: Navigate to `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`

## Pages Available

1. **Dashboard** (`/`) - Main admin interface
   - View connected clients
   - Select client to view/manage their bingo board
   - Admin controls for square management
   - Activity log

2. **SignalR Demo** (`/signalr-demo`) - Client simulator for testing
   - Connect/disconnect simulation
   - Request bingo sets
   - Simulate square clicks
   - View real-time messages

## Usage Workflow

1. **Admin starts the application** - Dashboard loads and connects to SignalR hub
2. **Clients connect** (via the demo page or external client) - Appears in connected clients list
3. **Client requests bingo set** - Gets randomized 25 squares, stored in cache
4. **Admin selects client** - Views client's current bingo board
5. **Admin/Client updates squares** - Real-time updates across all connected interfaces
6. **Win detection** - Automatic bingo detection and notification

## Bingo Squares Categories

The system includes squares categorized as:
- **bug** - Bug-related events (red border)
- **dev** - Development moments (blue border)  
- **quote** - Memorable quotes (purple border)
- **oops** - Mistakes/accidents (orange border)
- **meta** - Meta-commentary (gray border)
- **free** - Free space (yellow background)

## Future Enhancements

- Persistent storage (database instead of cache)
- User authentication and authorization
- Multiple game sessions/rooms
- Custom bingo set creation
- Statistics and analytics
- Mobile-responsive improvements
- Push notifications

## Technical Notes

- All async operations properly handled with error catching
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- Clean architecture with dependency injection
- SignalR connection management with automatic reconnection
- Responsive design with Bootstrap grid system
- Font Awesome icons for enhanced UI
